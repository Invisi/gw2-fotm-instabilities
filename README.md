# GW2 Fractal Instabilties for T4

## How to use this
There's basically two options at the moment:
- Use [Aleeva](https://aleeva.io)'s API. At the moment the API documentation is not finished but you can just contact itsmefox#0001 on Discord or join the Aleeva server.
- Integrate [data.json](data.json) into your own bot. The `instabilities` object contains the fractal level as key and the corresponding instabilities as values
  - e.g. `data["instabilities"]["76"][0]` gives the instabilities for level 76 on `????-01-01`.

## The format of `data.json`
Here's a commented TypeScript interface.
```ts
enum FractalLevel {
    "76",
    // ...,
    "100"
}

type Instabilities = Array<number>; // List of instabilities in GW2's order
type Days = Array<Instabilities>; // Zero-indexed list of instabilities for a whole year

export interface Data {
    instabilities: { [x in FractalLevel]: Days };
    instability_names: string[]; // List of instability names, indexed in `instabilities`
}
```
**ðŸ›‘ Keep in mind that <span style="color:red">the index of `Days` does include the leap day</span> and you will have account for that. ðŸ›‘**
